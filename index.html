					Hi! 👋 My name is <span class = "bold"> Aparna Bharathala</span>.
					<br>
					<br>
					I’m a senior at UC Berkeley 🐻 studying <a href = "https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/data-science-major" class = "about-links" target = "_blank"> Data Science</a> & <a href = "https://cogsci.berkeley.edu/major-program" class = "about-links" target = "_blank"> Cognitive Science</a>. I am graduating in May 2020 🎓and interested in Data Science & Full-Stack Development.
					<br> 
					<br>
					This past summer, I worked at <span class = "bold"> Bank of America</span> 🏦 as an intern on the Cloud and Advanced Technology team. I was responsible for developing an end-to-end solution to help clients understand what data access the Bank has on them. 
					<br>
					<br>
					In my spare time I love to sing 🎤, spend time with family and friends 👪, and during winter, curl up in bed with a cup of hot chocolate ☕.
					<br>
					<br>
					Check out my <a class = "about-links" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g9eOM77BVj1XwlX4Hp73vUPygbi2tv8f/view?usp=sharing" target = "_blank"> resume</a>, <a class = "about-links" href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/abharathala/" target = "_blank"> LinkedIn</a>, <a class = "about-links" href = "projects.html"> projects</a>, and <a class = "about-links" href = "graphicDesigns.html"> graphic designs </a> for more information!
